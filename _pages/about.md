I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics at New York University, and I'm passionate about maximizing the scientific discoveries of next-generation telescope missions.  
All data analysis models rely on assumptions about the data.  
To overcome the obstacles of the enormous rate of data acquisition and the unprecedented signal-to-noise floor, astronomers will have to learn to efficiently extract information about the universe from data that violates the assumptions that underlie traditional analysis techniques.
I develop novel methods that treat uncertainty-dominated data as inherently probabilistic to study cosmology, with a particular focus on the accelerating expansion of the universe and the time-variable sky.
